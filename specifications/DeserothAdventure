Deseroth Adventure Production Plan
----------------------------------

This will be a new game added to the Deseroth Series.
It will be an RPG Adventure Game.

Included in the RPG game will be Quests, Money, Items, and Monsters.
Quests will be completed by a player to gain experience to allow the character to level up and be able to fight stronger monsters.
Money will be utilized by a player to purchase items.
Items will be used inside of a player's inventory and some will be equipable as equipment, and some will be disposable like food. Items may also be necessary to complete quests.
Monsters will range bewteen various levels, possibly leveling up with the character. This would allow for fairly even game play.

The battle system to be used will be a turn based battle system, much like how older RPG games used to be.
As the theme of the game is more of a fantasy, magic will be incorporated as abilities.
There will only be the main character moving around to completel quests.

More will need to be added to add a story, and more specifics about the features included in the game.
